// The search's reusable index: tasks, learn notes, channel posts and votes, each parsed and
// lower-cased once and kept in one cache with a byte budget. A request lists folders and checks
// file stamps; it reads and parses only what changed since an earlier request.
//
// Every request scans the whole corpus in the same order, which defeats a least-recently-used
// cache: once the corpus is larger than the budget, each request evicts the entries it needs
// next and rereads everything. So the cache never evicts a valid entry to make room. It admits
// new entries while they fit and keeps them until their files change or go away.
//
// The cache alone does not bound a request: a store larger than the cache, or one huge item,
// is read again on every request. So each request also has a fixed work budget
// (`SEARCH_WORK`): file system calls and bytes read, counted before each call is made. A
// request that reaches it stops reading and answers with what it has, marked partial. Items
// read by earlier requests stay cached and cost only their stamp checks, so repeated searches
// cover more of a large store until the cache is full.
//
// A request that stops early must not stop at the same place next time, or whatever lies past
// that point is never searched. So each folder is walked from where the last request stopped,
// wrapping around at its end (`walk`), and each root gets its own share of the budget.
